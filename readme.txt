* About
In early 1999 I started work on an Atari 2600 Action Pack for the Gameboy Color
which was to include H.E.R.O., Pitfall I & II, plus a bunch of other classic
games. There was also to be an updated Pitfall II game with lots of extended
rooms to explore and creatures to avoid and treasures to collect. This is an
early version of the level editor that was developed to enable creation of the
new levels. It doesn't have all of the features in it that a later version
did and I am still trying to locate that in my archives.

* Pre-requisites
1. VisualBASIC 6


* Support
Absolutely none provided.
